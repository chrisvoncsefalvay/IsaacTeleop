// Helpers for exposing fixed-size FlatBuffers struct arrays to Python as NumPy views.
//
// A FlatBuffers struct array is interleaved (array of structs), so a field is exposed as a
// strided view rather than a packed buffer; NumPy and DLPack both carry strides natively,
// so such views satisfy the retargeting engine's NDArrayType tensor contract without a copy.
//
// Two ways to reach a field, in order of preference:
//
//   1. Take its address through the generated accessor. flatc returns nested structs by
//      const reference, so &joint.pose().position() is an ordinary member address: the
//      compiler does the arithmetic, and renaming or removing the field in the .fbs breaks
//      the build. No offset is involved.
//   2. Only when 1 is impossible: FBS_FIELD_OFFSET below. flatc returns scalars *by value*
//      (through EndianScalar), so scalar fields have no addressable accessor and their
//      offset has to be looked up.

// little-endian host — as do all supported targets (x86_64, ARM64), where EndianScalar()
// compiles to a no-op. Fail the build rather than silently byte-swapped data if that ever
// stops being true; a big-endian port would need packed copies, not views.

// MiniReflectTypeTable() is not constexpr, and the generated members are private so offsetof
// cannot name them. Hence a runtime lookup, resolved once at binding time, that throws on
