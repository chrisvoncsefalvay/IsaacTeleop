"""Race regression test for PairedFrameSource.

The bug: the original "consume both, drop if either is None" logic
threw away whichever eye published first whenever the consumer polled
between the two eyes' publishes. At ~1 kHz consumer poll vs ~45 fps
producer, that race hit roughly every cycle and halved the effective
fps with a very stuttery display.

The fix caches each eye's most recent frame and emits a pair on any
update. No GPU needed — pure Python with a controllable fake source.
