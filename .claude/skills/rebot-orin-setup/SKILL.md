  Use when initializing a reBot B601-RS (RobStride 6-DOF, seven motors) arm
  from an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin using the Orin's built-in CAN (mttcan) via an external
  SN65HVD230 transceiver — no USB-CAN/PCAN adapter. Covers the uv/motorbridge
  env, bringing up can0 @ 1 Mbit, verifying the bus, reboot persistence,
  motor-ID assignment, zero calibration, and the CAN bring-up troubleshooting
  tree (loopback-passes-but-no-motors, pinmux, motor power).
